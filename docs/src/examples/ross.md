## A repair problem

### Source

Ross, Simulation 5th edition, Section 7.7, p. 124-126

### Description

A system needs $n$ working machines to be operational. To guard against machine breakdown, additional machines are kept available as spares. Whenever a machine breaks down it is immediately replaced by a spare and is itself sent to the repair facility, which consists of a single repairperson who repairs failed machines one at a time. Once a failed machine has been repaired it becomes available as a spare to be used when the need arises. All repair times are independent random variables having the common distribution function $G$. Each time a machine is put into use the amount of time it functions before breaking down is a random variable, independent of the past, having distribution function $F$.

The system is said to “crash” when a machine fails and no spares are available. Assuming that there are initially $n + s$ functional machines of which $n$ are put in use and $s$ are kept as spares, we are interested in simulating this system so as to approximate $E[T]$, where $T$ is the time at which the system crashes.
