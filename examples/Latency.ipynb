    "In this example we show how to separate the time delay between processes from the processes themselves. We model a communications channel, called a `Cable`, where a sender sends messages regularly each `SEND_PERIOD` time units and a receiver listens each `RECEIVE_PERIOD`. The messages in the cable have a delay fo `DELAY_DURATION` until they reach the recevier."
